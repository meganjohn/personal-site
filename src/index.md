I'm Megan, a London-based aspiring software developer. I'm currently working at a digital marketing agency in central London and spend my free time exercising, reading, and learning to code. I am using this site as a place to improve my coding, learn and try out new things, and as somewhere to store some articles that I have written on various topics - it's a real mix of stuff!

Below you can find a link to my first posts of many!
