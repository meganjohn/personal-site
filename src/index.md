I'm Megan, a junior Java developer currently working at a media and entertainment business in central London.  I spend my free time exercising, reading, and sewing.

My main stack is **Java, GraphQL, and some SQL** with additional technologies including Kubernetes, Terraform, Git, gRPC and Prometheus to name a few.  If you'd like to reach out and discuss any opportunities that you have open in your business then please contact me via the Twitter profile linked in the navigation bar.

I am using this site as a place to improve my coding, learn and try out new things, and as somewhere to store some articles that I have written on various topics - it's a real mix of stuff!
