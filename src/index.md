I'm Megan, a London-based aspiring software developer. I'm currently working at a digital marketing agency in central London and spend my free time exercising, reading, and learning to code.

My current stack is **HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Node.js** - always looking to develop my existing skills and learn new frameworks or languages.

If you'd like to reach out and discuss any opportunities that you have open in your business then please use my Twitter profile linked in the navigation bar.

I am using this site as a place to improve my coding, learn and try out new things, and as somewhere to store some articles that I have written on various topics - it's a real mix of stuff!
