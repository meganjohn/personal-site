<!-- Excerpt Start -->
This weekend I saw 1917 in the cinema and went to the 24/7 exhibition at Somerset House<!-- Excerpt End -->:

- 1917 was an incredible watch and such a necessary film.  Definitely one of the few films that I believe is truly worth seeing in a cinema.

- Somerset House is a gorgeous property and walking around I wished that I could live there - it was amazing!

- The 24/7 exhibit was full of some really thought-provoking installations including a 360-immersive audio experience which was very unsettling.

- One of the first installations (a very bright light that flashed on and off) was almost certainly stolen from an episode of Gilmore Girls.
