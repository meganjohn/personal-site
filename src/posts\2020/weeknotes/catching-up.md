<!-- Excerpt Start -->
This is the first time in a couple of weeks that I've sat down and really wanted to write another weeknote.<!-- Excerpt End --> So here's a quick rundown of what I've been up to:

- Went to see Be More Chill at The Other Palace which was an awesome show and I highly recommend!

- Had my first session with a new therapist who I really think is great - she's going to help me with a lot of introspection.

- Watched Nick play hockey for the first time. One of the guys on his team went over on his ankle and it swelled to double size which was a bit more excitement than I was expecting.

- Celebrated Mardi Gras with a jazz concert and pancake party with great friends.

- Started learning about test driven development! Managed to write my first unit tests and functions through paired programming which is the start of a small Twitter app. Check out the codebase so far on my <a href="https://github.com/meganjohn/twitterApp" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
