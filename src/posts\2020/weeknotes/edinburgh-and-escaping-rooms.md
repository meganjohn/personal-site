<!-- Excerpt Start -->
I spent four days in Edinburgh this week visiting our head office up there.<!-- Excerpt End -->  The train journey takes 4.5 hours each way so I try not to go very often if I can avoid it but, since I hadn't seen my team in person since before Christmas it was time.

We had a team social on Thursday to an escape room: <a href="https://www.escapereality.com/escape-rooms-uk/edinburgh/">Escape the Asylum</a> which was a great evening out. Big shout out to Calum who was our gamemaster - the acting when introducing the story was very convincing! Other than a couple of moments of disagreement over whether to ask for a hint or not, the game was a huge success and we made it out with 10 minutes to spare.

As lovely as it is to spend some time in a nice studio apartment just a 5 minute walk to the office, cooking whatever I fancy for dinner and lunch because it gets expensed, it's definitely good to be home.
