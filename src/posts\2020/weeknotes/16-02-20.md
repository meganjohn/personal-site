<!-- Excerpt Start -->
It was one of those weeks where I feel like I did very little but looking back, did a lot.<!-- Excerpt End -->

- Baked a cheesecake to take to a dinner party at a friend's house - it went down very well!

- Went out for dinner to a gluten free restaurant: <a href="https://www.nichefoodanddrink.com/" alt="nichefoodanddrink.com">Niche</a>, which was absolutely incredible.  So nice to be able to order anything from the menu for once!

- Threw a surprise birthday party for my housemate between our other housemate and other friends.  It went down really well and she was definitely surprised!
