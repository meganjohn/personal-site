<!-- Excerpt Start -->
This week brought a conversation with the head of our R&D team about whether there could be an opportunity for me to move into their team.<!-- Excerpt End -->  I have come to realise that it's crucial to be open with an employer about aspirations for my career development.  

Having decided over the last 6 months that I see my future in software development, and having started the journey toward making this a reality, it was time to be open with my current employer about this and scope out whether this was possible without leaving the business.

Unfortunately, the answer was that it wouldn't be a possibility in the foreseeable future.  My dissatisfaction in my current role is still something that needs addressing and so, when my weekly survey came around and contained the question of whether I wanted to raise anything but felt awkward doing so, I saw this as a prime opportunity to do just that.  I explained to my manager that I don't share the same passion for the industry that my colleagues seem to and I'd like to discuss any options for adapting my role to something I can be more passionate about.

This is all likely to be a long process and I am still working towards my goal of a career in software development but, as I have no real timeline for how far away my first junior developer role is, I need to make sure that my current role is as enjoyable as possible in the meantime.
